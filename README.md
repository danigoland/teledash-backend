## Configuration
Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it according to your needs. The defaults are listed below:

| Name     |      Value      |
|----------|-----------------|
| ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`` | Project name. |
| ``MONGO_HOST`` | Hostname for MongoDB. Default: _"mongo"_ (forwards to the "mongo" docker container). |
| ``MONGO_USER`` | Username for MongoDB. |
| ``MONGO_PASSWORD`` | Password for MongoDB. |
| ``MONGO_DB_NAME`` | Name of MongoDB database. |

| ``FLOWER_USER`` | User to access Flower. |
| ``FLOWER_PASSWORD`` | Password to access Flower. |
| ``SCRAPE_CHATS_MAX_DAYS`` | Number of days content in chats will be scraped backwards (when scraping for the first time). Set to *0* to scrape all content. Warning: Scraping all content of a chat can take several days. Default: _"7"_ |
| ``SCRAPE_CHATS_INTERVAL_MINUTES`` | Interval in minutes new messages of chats will be scraped. Default: _"30"_ |
| ``SAVE_ATTACHMENT_TYPES`` | Attachments that will be downloaded and stored. Default: _["photo","audio","document","animation","video","voice","video_note","sticker"]_ |
| ``KEEP_ATTACHMENT_FILES_DAYS`` | Number of days attachments will be deleted after automatically. Set to *0* to keep files. |
| ``STORAGE_ENDPOINT`` | Endpoint for S3-compatible object storage e.g. MinIO. Default: _"host.docker.internal:9000"_ (forwards to the minio docker container) |
| ``STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`` | API username for object storage. |
| ``STORAGE_SECRET_KEY`` | API key for object storage. |
| ``JWT_SECRET`` | JWT secret (token) |
| ``JWT_LIFETIME_SECONDS`` | Lifetime of JWT in seconds. Default: _"3600"_ (1 hour) |
| ``OCR_ASR_FALLBACK_LANGUAGE`` | Fallback [language code (ISO 639-1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes) for text and speech recognition if language of chat can't be detected automatically. Default: _"en"_ |
| ``OCR_ENABLED`` | Whether text recognition (OCR) for images using [tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/) is enabled. If enabled make sure _SAVE_ATTACHMENT_TYPES_ includes _"photo"_. Pretrained models are [available for 120+ languages](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html) and will be downloaded automatically if _OCR_MODEL_TYPE_ is _"fast"_ or _"best"_. Default: _"fast"_ |
| ``OCR_MODEL_TYPE`` | The model type being used for OCR. Can be _"fast"_, _"best"_ or _"custom"_. Fast models are fast and need less ressoures but are less accurate. Best models need more ressources, take longer but are more accurate. |
| ``ASR_ENABLED`` | Whether speech recognition (ASR) using [vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) is enabled. If enabled make sure _SAVE_ATTACHMENT_TYPES_ includes _"voice"_. |
| ``ASR_LANGUAGE`` | [Language code (ISO 639-1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes) for the language speech recognition (ASR) should be performed. Currently only one language is supported at once. Default: _"en"_ |
| ``ASR_MODEL_NAME`` | Model name for speech recognition. Pretrained models are [available for 20+ languages](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) and will be downloaded automatically. For these languages usually exist _"small"_ and _"big"_ models. Small models are fast and need less ressoures but are less accurate. Big models need more ressources, take longer but are more accurate. Note: Big models require up to 16 GB memory. Default: _"vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15"_ (small english model) |
| ``API_ALLOW_ORIGINS`` | From which domain the API will be accessible. Default: _"["http://localhost:3000"]"_ (only accessible from localhost) |

*Note: Scraping for the first time can take several hours to days to download and process all content depending on the configuration settings, available ressources and number of telegram clients used.*

## Requirements
- Object Storage (S3 compatible) e.g. [MinIO Server](https://min.io/download#/docker) (see below),
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Deployment

Clone this repository, change configuration accordingly (see above) and run `docker-compose up`.

Make sure to change `JWT_SECRET`, `FLOWER_USER`, `FLOWER_PASSWORD`, `MONGO_USER` and `MONGO_PASSWORD` as the mongodb instance will be accessible remotely by default.

---

## Export
### Database

The database can be exported in different ways:

#### Bash Script
There's a bash script that takes a collection name and exports that collection to a specified location ("outfile path") as a JSON-file.
Usage:
```shell
$ ./scripts/export/export.sh <collection name> <outfile path>
```

#### MongoDB Compass
Alternatively, you can export the database via the GUI [MongoDB Compass](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/current/import-export/) as JSON or CSV.

### MinIO / Object Storage
Use the command-line [MinIO client](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-complete-guide.html) (e. g. `mc cp  --recursive minio/[SOURCE] [TARGET]`), the web interface [MinIO console](https://docs.min.io/minio/baremetal/console/minio-console.html) (by default available at `http://localhost:9001`) or [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) (using a [generic S3 profile](https://docs.cyberduck.io/protocols/s3/)) if you want to download all attachments from the object storage.

---

## Development

We use [VS Code Remote-Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) for the development setup. To start developing in a Docker container, run the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container**-Command from the Command Palette and select the *worker* or *api*-folder.

### API
#### Starting the API
```shell
$ uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```
#### Endpoints
Once the API is up and running you can open the interactive documentation of the API at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

#### Default user
The default username is admin@example.com (password: 12345678). Make sure to change this after deployment.

### Worker
Start Celery by running the VSCode task "Celery workers".

To test the scraping tasks, execute in a python shell:

```python
>>> from worker.tasks import init_scrapers
>>> init_scrapers.delay()
```

### MinIO object storage
We use MinIO for object storage in development.

To setup a local MinIO instance with persistent storage, run:
```shell
$ mkdir -p ~/minio/data

$ docker run \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    -p 9001:9001 \
    --name minio1 \
    -v ~/minio/data:/data \
    -e "MINIO_ROOT_USER=username" \
    -e "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=password" \
    quay.io/minio/minio server /data --console-address ":9001"
```
Don't forget to update `MINIO_ROOT_USER` and `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`. They must have the same values as `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY` and `STORAGE_SECRET_KEY` in the `.env`-file.

For more info check out the [MinIO Quickstart Guide](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-docker-quickstart-guide.html).

### MinIO Client
If you want to access MinIO via CLI follow the [MinIO Client Guide](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-complete-guide).

Then:
```shell
$ mc alias set <ALIAS> <YOUR-S3-ENDPOINT> [YOUR-ACCESS-KEY] [YOUR-SECRET-KEY] [--api API-SIGNATURE]
```
Alias is simply a short name to your cloud storage service.

#### Removing buckets
```shell
$ mc rb minio/[BUCKET_NAME] minio/[BUCKET_NAME] ... --force
```

### Useful Docker commands

#### Open authenticated MongoDB-shell in mongo container:
```shell
$ scripts/open-mongosh.sh
```

#### Recreate MongoDB indexes
The file `scripts/mongo-init.js` is executed once when Mongodb starts for the first time. To recreate all indexes (e.g. after dropping a collection), run:
```shell
$ scripts/rerun-mongo-init.sh
```


#### Open a shell inside container:
```shell
$ docker exec -it <container id or name> /bin/bash
```
As root:
```shell
$ docker exec -it --user root <container id or name> /bin/bash
```

## Other Notes

### Obtaining API credentials from Telegram
For scraping you need to register at least one (Telegram) client and [obtain api_id and api_hash](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id#obtaining-api-id).

### Vosk on Apple Silicon Macs
There's no official Vosk-package for Apple Silicon (arm64) CPUs, but a workaround. To make Vosk work on M1/M2 open `/worker/requirements.txt` and replace `vosk` with `https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api/releases/download/v0.3.32/vosk-0.3.32-py3-none-linux_aarch64.whl`
